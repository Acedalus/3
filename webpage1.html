<h1>I do a whole bunch of stuff</h1>
<article>
<p>I have a lot of hobbies. I like to spend time out doors fishing, hunting, or adventuring.
	When I'm at home I play videogames and try to build/fix stuff. I enjoy working on cars specifically.
	I'd love to build a racecar one day when I have money to do so. I also read a lot of fiction as well as
	historical non-fiction regarding post 1900 warfare.
