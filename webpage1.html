<h1>A brief description of me</h1>
<h3>Where I'm from</h3>
<p>I'm from a military family so I've lived in several states and travelled to almost all of them.
	I've lived in Nebraska for longer than I would've liked, going on ten years now.
<h3>What I do</h3>
<p>I'm majoring in MIS and I've been attending college for over four years now. I'm ready to graduate and take a short break from education.
	I have a lot of hobbies. I like to spend time out doors fishing, hunting, or adventuring.
	When I'm at home I play videogames and try to build/fix stuff. I enjoy working on cars specifically.
	I'd love to build a racecar one day when I have money to do so. I also read a lot of fiction as well as
	historical non-fiction regarding post 1900 warfare.
