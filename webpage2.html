<h2>A brief history of tanks</2>
<h4>The beginning</h4>
<img src="http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww1/gb/photos/British_Mark_I_Tank.jpg">
<p>The inception of mobilized armor is first found in the early 19th century.
During WW1, the Eastern front is stagnated due to trench warfare. The british develop the
Mark I landship to break through heavy defense. The French, Germans, Russians, and Americans sonn afterwards develop
their own vehicles as well.
</p>
<h4>Inter-War period</h4>

<p>After WW1 ends, the allies further develop their armored vehicles. At this time, tanks mainly fulfill an
infantry support role. The main advances at this time are speed and reliabilty. The Germans are forbidden
from developing armor due to the Versailles treaty. However, when Hitler comes into power he starts developing
tanks under the guise of tractors. By the late 30's most tanks are smaller and armed with MGs or light cannons.
</p>
<h4>WW2</h4>

<p>Tank development really takes off in WW2. When Hitlers army circumvents the Maginot line by traversing the
Ardennnes forest, the first Tank vs Tank battles will take place, pitting french and british technology against the germans.
As the war progresses, tank construction begins to vary wildly. The germans develop complicated yet lethal heavy and medium tanks
like the PzKpFw V Tiger and PzKpFw VI Panther. The allies choose to develop simple and affordable vehicles that can be mass produced.
The M4 Sherman and the T-34 are the most commonly seen examples of these mass produced machines.
Each country also creates their own versions of tank destroyers and mobile artillery.
</p>
<h4>Cold War period</h4>

<p>After the war ends, tank design slowly starts to gravitate towards modern day MBT design.
New tanks that are developed are faster, better armed and armored, and designed to complete a variety of objectives.
One of the most widely used tanks ever to be produced is developed during this time. The Russian T-55 was sold to a multitude of countries and
can still found fighting in places like the middle east to this day.
</p>
<h4>Late Cold War and Modern Day</h4>

<p>Since the 80's tank development has lost most of it's variety that was present in WW1 and WW2. The tanks developed now, referred to as Main Battle Tanks,
are designed to support infantry and square off against other armored vehicles. These tanks are fast, well armed with missiles and advanced cannons, and outfitted with
advanced armor designed to keep the tanks and their crews alive. The M1A2 Abrhams and the T-72 are prime examples of these MBTs.
